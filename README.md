# Ultimate Retro Shader Collection Demo

This repository contains the source code and downloadable executables for the [Ultimate Retro Shader Collection](https://github.com/Zorochase/ultimate-retro-shader-collection) (URSC) demo. If you're looking to integrate URSC into your project, this demo will showcase most of what it has to offer. It can be played through your browser on [itch.io](https://zorochase.itch.io/ultimate-retro-shader-collection-for-godot)! You can also download it by heading to [Releases](https://github.com/Zorochase/ultimate-retro-shader-collection-demo/releases).

Before June 11, 2024, the demo and collection were part of the same repository. Since then, they've been separated to allow changes and fixes to the demo without affecting the shader collection itself. The first version of the demo released after this split was 1.3.0.
